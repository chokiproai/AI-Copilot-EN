## Introduction
- ⭐ Based on Microsoft New Bing, the Microsoft New Bing website is simply customized with Vue3 and Go. It has a consistent user interface experience, supports ChatGPT prompts, is available, and basically compatible with all functions of Microsoft Bing AI. You can chat without logging in.

- ⭐ When the official Bing chat server (relatively fast and stable, recommended), you can refer to the following solutions

- ⭐ Chat server (default is "Your website"). The number of requests is limited to 100,000 per day. It can be switched in Settings => Service selection in the upper right corner.

- ⭐ Available (the deployed server is directly connected to www.bing.com without CN redirection and can configure the connection)

- ⭐ Supports available open-source ChatGPT vocabulary prompts

- ⭐ When you need advanced functions like drawing, etc. (you need to command).

- ⭐ If you encounter any problems, first click on the lower-left corner! Try it, if it doesn't work, use the refresh method (Shift + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R or settings in the upper right corner and choose to delete cookies) and the last tip is to clear the browser's cache and cookies, such as (24-hour limit, not logged in reminder, etc.)

- ⭐ Please select Creative Conversation Mode

### How to get BING_COOKIE (If you want to use for Image Creator)

> Configuring BING_COOKIE means you are sharing your account with all users of this service, the drawing function does not need to log in, then you should set this variable. Open https://www.bing.com and log in, then Copy Cookie
