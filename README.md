## Introduction
- ⭐ Based on Microsoft New Bing, the Microsoft New Bing website is simply customized with Vue3 and Go. It has a consistent user interface experience, supports ChatGPT prompts, is available and basically compatible with all functions of Microsoft Bing AI. Can chat without logging in.

- ⭐ When the official Bing chat server (relatively fast and stable, recommended), you can refer to the following solutions

- ⭐ Chat server (default is "Your Website"). The number of requests is limited to 100,000 per day. It can be switched in Settings => Service selection in the upper right corner.

- ⭐ Available (the deployed server is directly connected to www.bing.com without CN redirection and can be configured to connect)

- ⭐ Supports existing open-source ChatGPT vocabulary prompts

- ⭐ When you need advanced features like drawing, etc. (you need to command).

- ⭐ If you encounter any problems, first click on the lower left corner! Try it, if it doesn't work, use the refresh method (Shift + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R or settings in the upper right corner and select delete cookies) and the last tip is to clear the browser's cache and cookies, such as (24-hour limit, reminder not logged in, etc.)
